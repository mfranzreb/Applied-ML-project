Version 0:
Hyperparams:
- learning_rate: 0.001
- batch_size: 100
- num_epochs: 500
- layers: 8 layers with 100 units each, ReLu activation
- optimizer: Adam
- dtype: float32

After 500 epochs, loss still converging, has periodic peaks. Final loss: 1.67e-04
Average distances vary wildly, between 0.001 and 0.03. 
Max distances much bigger than average

Test loss: 0.0001761

After 2000 iterations, convergence starts, with loss of 1.72e-05
Average distances much better, between 0.001 and 0.003
Max distances still around one order of magnitude bigger than average

Test loss: 0.000240 -> worse than after 500 epochs, maybe indicative of overfitting/bad generalization

Version 1:
Same as version 0 but lr = 0.003
Training loss worse and more unstable than version 0
Distances also more erratic

Version 2:
Hyperparams:
- learning_rate: 0.001
- batch_size: 100
- num_epochs: 2000
- layers: 1 conv2d layer with 10 2x2 filters, 1 conv2d layer with 10 2x10 filters, 1 maxpool3d with kernel of 10x1x2, and 4 fully connected layers going from 50 to 100, ReLu activation
- optimizer: Adam
- dtype: float32

Average distances worse than version 0, with very high peaks, and more erratic
Max distances even more erratic
Training loss converges to 1.5e-04, but with a lot of oscillations
Test loss surprisingly good, at 0.00014

Version 4:
- Loss is average distance, same NN as v0.
Results:
- After 100 epochs/13k steps, Convergence starting.
- AVg and max distances slightly worse, but 1000 less epochs, so promising.

Version 5, 6, 7:
- v4 with batches of 30, 60, 200 respectively.
Results:
- Batch sizes of 60 and 30 converge slower than 100, with worse loss.
- 200 is almost identical to 100

Version 8:
- v0 but with loss being max distance
- Avg and max distances are much worse (2x) than with loss being avg distance

Version 9:
- input as image
- CNN from paper 9
- 340 epochs(15k steps)

Results:
Although testloss similar, results much worse, zig-zagging airfoils.

Version 10:
- Same as v0 but 200, 400, 800, 1600, 1600, 800, 400, 200
- 2000 epochs

Results:
- Best result but possible overfitting, distances higher on test
